        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have worked in Winter Springs at Stefano's Trattoria for 11 years now and will miss doing it immensely.</p>
        <p>Even though I have never formally trained in any other field besides in the military, I believe that my experiences in life and my extreme work ethic will go a long way in my web development studies as well.</p>
          <p>I believe that my time in the military and dedication to improving everyday will help me to excell in my learning, even when I think it is going to slow. I will tackle this challenge with a never say die attitude and acomplish whatever God has for me to acomplish.</p>
        <p>I am excited to see where this journey takes me and encouraged by the possibilities it brings.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I have a family that I love and care for and a son with autism who's mom is busy at work becoming his homeschooling teacher. It is up to me to develop (no pun intended) into someone who can provide in a different way than I am used to. I'm looking forward to continuing in this challenging endeavor.</p>
          <p>I also have a few things to bring to the table. Even though they don't directly relate to coding, I think they'll come to be beneficial as I take on the road ahead and all  the challenges involved.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Paris Island (U.S.M.C)</li>
          <li>Field Artillery\Fire Direction</li>
          <li>15+ years in service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I used to watch and play basketball. I enjoy reading my bible and other literature. There are a few things I am working on while we figure out how life is sopposed to be moving forward:</p>
        <ul class="hobbies">
          <li>Nutrition</li>
          <li>Fitness</li>
          <li>Spiritual Health</li>
          <li>Learning a new skill</li>
          <li>Gaining employment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Iâ€™d like to work at something that I truly enjoy. I have never found that before and never would have if this opportunity hadn't presented itself to me. I am grateful for the time and the instruction at teamTreehouse. I believe with their help I can be great at this.</p>
