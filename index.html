        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who tried to go through the teamTreehouse front-end track on the 25$/ month plan. I've found that in order to enjoy the full range of what they have to offer, including the ability to download and follow the coding in my own code editor has been profoundly different even within the first project I'm starting with them.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional server and bar-tender and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>It is my main goal to learn front-end development and increase my abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to find a job where I can help others grow in their knowledge of development and increase my own as well.</p>
          <p>The background-image I used is, unfortunately, not indicitive of where I live. It only portrays what I wish it looked like. I am excited to grow in development, so as to have the option of going somewhere like this whenever I please.</p>
